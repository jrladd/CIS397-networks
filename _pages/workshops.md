To keep them from cluttering the main assignments page, this page contains links to all of the in-class "workshop" assignments. You'll also find these linked on the schedule page.

For all of the workshops, you can refer to the [Criteria for Good Reports](/CIS241/criteria/) as a guide to what is expected in these assignments.
