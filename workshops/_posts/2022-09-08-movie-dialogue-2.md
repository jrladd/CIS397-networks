This is our second weekly in-class "workshop" assignment. Typically, you'll download a Jupyter Notebook file and a dataset, and you'll work on the assignment in class on Thursday. Sometimes you'll be able to finish the assignment by the end of class, and other times they will take longer. You'll submit the finished notebook to the Sakai assignment by 9am the following Tuesday.

This week we're continuing our work on a data set of dialogue in movies.

Data set: <a href="/CIS241/data/Pudding-Film-Dialogue.csv" download>Puddling-Film-Dialogue.csv</a>

Notebook file: <a href="/CIS241/resources/movie_dialogue2.ipynb" download>movie_dialogue2.ipynb</a>
