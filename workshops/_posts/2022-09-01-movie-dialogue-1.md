This is our first weekly in-class "workshop" assignment. Typically, you'll download a Jupyter Notebook file and a dataset, and you'll work on the assignment in class on Thursday. Sometimes you'll be able to finish the assignment by the end of class, and other times they will take longer. You'll turn in the assignment by the following class on Tuesday, on the corresponding Sakai assignment.

This week we're working on a data set of dialogue in movies.

Data set: <a href="/CIS241/data/Pudding-Film-Dialogue.csv" download>Puddling-Film-Dialogue.csv</a>

Notebook file: <a href="/CIS241/resources/movie_dialogue1.ipynb" download>movie_dialogue1.ipynb</a>
