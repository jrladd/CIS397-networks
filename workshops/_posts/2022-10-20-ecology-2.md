As always, download the Jupyter Notebook file, and you'll work on the assignment in class on Thursday. You'll turn in your work by 9am Tuesday, on the Sakai assignment for this workshop.

This week we're continuing to work on a data set of Pittsburgh's urban trees. You can use the same dataset you downloaded last time.
