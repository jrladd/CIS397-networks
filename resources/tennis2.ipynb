    "## Finding Correlations, Exploring the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've gained some familiarity with the data, we want to see what factors might correlate with the length of tennis matches. Thankfully, the data provides us with a `minutes`  variable that tells us exactly how long each match lasted. This will be our *dependent variable* for all of our subsequent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's up to you to choose some *independent variables* that might correlate with the length of the game. Look over the data and choose a few possible variables. You'll need to investigate the data's documentation in order to understand all the abbreviations! Thankfully Sackmann provides [a file that explains what all the column abbreviations mean](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp/blob/master/matches_data_dictionary.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this section, choose 4 independent variables from the data set, list them, and explain why you chose each one. Use your common sense and knowledge of the data to pick variables you think could plausibly have an effect on the length of the game. Remember that independent variables for correlation *must be numerical*.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Then, make 4 regression plots (using `lmplot`) to compare each independent variable with `minutes`. Interpret each plot, explaining whether or not there appears to be a trend or correlation. (You could also make these joint plots if you wanted to, but they shouldn't be plain scatter plots.)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finally, calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient between each of your independent variables and `minutes`. (Keep track of these with distinct variable names.) Explain whether the coefficient says the correlation is positive or negative, strong or weak. Is this also reflected in the plots?**\n",
