    "# Analyzing Airbnb Rentals with Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb was founded in 2008 to allow people to rent apartments, houses, and spaces directly to one another. The company provides an alternative to traditional hotels and rentals. Recently there's been a lot of public discussion about the effects Airbnb rentals have on neighborhoods: as Airbnb gets more popular, more and more homes and apartments that were previously used as private residences are now becoming full-time rentals. The data activists and journalists at [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/) are using public information about rentals to better understand these phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we'll use a sample of [Inside Airbnb's data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data) to investigate the prices of Airbnb rentals in New Orleans, LA during the year 2021. New Orleans is a city with a lot of tourism that relies on hotels and rentals to house its many visitors. In this first workshop, we'll use linear regression to explore some variables that may affect the price of rentals.\n",

    "So, we need to get rid of the problem characters first. Right now, our price column has the data type string; it's a bit of text.

For now we're not doing a deep dive into regular expressions, but they'll come up again later in the semester.\n",
