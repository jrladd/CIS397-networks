    "# Movie Dialogue\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past 10 years, there's been a lot of public conversation about gender and racial imbalance in Hollywood. Movements like [#OscarsSoWhite](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/movies/oscarssowhite-history.html) and trends like [the Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) have explicitly called out the extent to which certain groups are underrepresented in Hollywood films. But exactly what are the proportions of representation in movies? Before we can address this apparent imbalance, we have to understand its scope and extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, a group of researchers working for the data visualization website [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) set out to do just that in order to better understand gender imbalance in film. They compiled a data set of approximately 2000 scripts from throughout movie history and, using text analysis, recorded how much each character speaks. The data was then refined and enhanced first by [Dr. Melanie Walsh](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/00-Datasets/00-Datasets.html#hollywood-film-dialogue-by-character-gender-and-age) and then by Dr. John Ladd. I (Dr. Ladd speaking) added genre categories and runtime information from the [larger IMDB dataset](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this census of film scripts, it's possible to better understand what gender imbalance looks like in movies across history and to ask questions about what may affect that imbalance. For example, we might ask: what factors affect the proportion of dialogue in a movie spoken by female characters?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion of gender bias and imbalance can be deeply sensitive. The issue of whether women are underrepresented in the film industry affects thousands of women actors, directors, and crew members. Representation is also essential for audiences: as long as movies remain a major cultural force, everyone wants to see themselves accurately and fairly portrayed on screen. It's important that data analysts neither underplay nor exaggerate the imbalances that exist in this industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "But gender, as a concept, is historically fraught, and using a binary definition of gender for a data analysis like this is useful but not fully accurate. I'll let [Dr. Walsh](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/03-Data-Analysis/03-Pandas-Basics-Part3.html#the-puddings-film-dialogue-data) explain:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Yet transforming complex social constructs like gender into quantifiable data is tricky and historically fraught. They [*The Pudding* researchers] claim, in fact, that one of the most [frequently asked questions](https://medium.com/@matthew_daniels/faq-for-the-film-dialogue-by-gender-project-40078209f751) about the piece is about gender: “Wait, but let’s talk about gender. How do you know the monster in Monsters Inc. is a boy!” The short answer is that they don’t. To determine character gender, they used actors’ IMDB information, which they acknowledge is an imperfect approach: “Sometimes, women voice male characters. Bart Simpson, for example, is voiced by a woman. We’re aware that this means some of the data is wrong, AND we’re still fine with the methodology and approach.”\n",
    "\n",
    ">As we work with this data, we want to be critical and cognizant of this approach to gender. How does such a binary understanding of gender, gleaned from the IMDB pages of actors, influence our later results and conclusions? What do we gain by using such an approach, and what do we lose? How else might we have encoded or determined gender for the same data?\n",
