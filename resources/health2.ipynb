    "# Modeling Health Data with Random Forest Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean for a *place* to be healthy? What can we learn about the overall health of people in the United States by looking at health by city and locality? These are the questions that the CDC's [PLACES](https://www.cdc.gov/places/about/index.html) project attempts to answer. This project originally began in 2015 as the \"500 Cities Project\": an annual survey of the 500 largest cities in the US. By surveying these cities every year, the CDC hopes to better understand long-term health among Americans all across the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we continue through the COVID-19 pandemic, data analysis focused on health and healthcare continues to be at the center of public conversation. Good data analysis in this domain is essential for public health in the 21st century. In this week's workshop, you'll examine recent data from the PLACES project to better understand American's overall health.\n",
    "\n",
    "***For this workshop, you will make a coherent and readable report. As you go through each section, make sure you are explaining, describing and interpreting all code, visualizations, and statistical output. The goal is that a reader with no previous knowledge of the data should be able to understand your findings.***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the same data from last time, import the necessary libraries and data. \n",
    "- Complete the same data wrangling steps you did last time to prepare the data for analysis. \n",
    "- *Make sure you use comments or markdown cells to explain each step of this process.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring Data with Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "While a random forest approach is best for accurate classification overall, individual decision trees are useful for exploring the data and understanding how variables interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using sklearn's `DecisionTreeClassifier`, fit a decision tree model to the data set. Use `StateAbbr` as your target. But **there are too many states to reasonably interpret the results**. Narrow down the data to just the two states with more than 40 cities in our data: Texas and California.\n",
    "- *Keep in mind all the steps that will go into this: preparing and splitting the data, standardizing the data, and fitting the model.*\n",
    "- Create a visualization of the decision tree. It should look like this one (the Penguins example from Tuesday):\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://jrladd.com/CIS241/slides/img/decisiontree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sci-kit learn has a built-in function to make these tree diagrams. Make sure it has colors and labels for each variable, just like the example above. You'll also need to make the figure size larger to make this readable.\n",
    "- (n.b.: Though the example above uses `entropy`, yours will say `gini`. This is showing the Gini impurity measure for each node.)\n",
    "- **Write an interpetation of your decision tree. What does it tell you about the relationships between your variables? Which variables seem most important? Will this help you determine hyperparameters when you fit your random forest classifier?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classifying Data with the Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "We still want to know if the health of people in certain cities varies strongly by state. Given information about a new city, could we correctly predict the state in which it's located? Let's see if we can get better results with the Random Forest than we did with KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `StateAbbr` as your target, and keep using the narrowed-down data for only Texas and California.\n",
    "- Choose some predictor variables. Will you use different ones this time, or the same ones you used for the single decision tree?\n",
    "- Run a Random Forest classification using these variables and targets. Make sure you've scaled the variables and done all appropriate pre-processing. **Explain your steps and interpret the results fully.**\n",
    "- Find the variable importance of each predictor. **Interpret these fully. Which variables were most important and why? Did this surprise you or not, based on what you learned from the decision tree?**\n",
    "- Use out-of-sample validation to check your model's confusion matrix, calculate appropriate measures, and make some visualizations. **How well did your model perform?** (Keep in mind that we couldn't do an ROC curve on Tuesday because we didn't have a binary classifier, but *this* classifier will be binary.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a brief summary of what you learned about American cities through this analysis. Did your random forest model perform better than KNN? Why or why not?  What other approaches might you recommend? Is there additional data on cities that you might want to add to this analyis?"
