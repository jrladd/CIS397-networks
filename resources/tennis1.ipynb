    "Sports analytics is one of the most popular and discussed forms of data analysis. No matter what sport interests you (gymnastics, football, skiing, etc., etc.), there is surely data out there and lots of people looking for ways to analyze and better understand the sport. Sometimes, the purpose of the data is to win more games! This, after all, is the plot of the movie *Moneyball*, in which the Oakland A's use data analysis to recruit players and increase their chances of winning the pennant.\n",

    "For this week's sports data workshop, we'll work with a data set from the 2015 French Open, which attempts to answer the question of why some tennis matches take a very long time to complete. Is it because of specific players, or is there some other factor? **To begin, import the libraries you will need below:**"
