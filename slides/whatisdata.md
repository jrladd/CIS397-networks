# What is Metadata?

## Types of Metadata

- *Descriptive* metadata can help you find and understand a dataset or resource. (e.g. titles and authors of books)
- *Administrative* metadata can help you manage a resource and tell you about how it was created. (e.g. publishers of books, or ebook file formats)
- *Structural* metadata can help you understand the different parts of the dataset and their relationship. (e.g. column labels, or tables of contents in books)

## Metadata has standards for interoperability.

[Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/) -- 13 features common to digital data

[DDI: Data Documentation Initiative](https://www.ddialliance.org/) -- social, behavioral, and economic sciences

[MARC: MAchine Readable Cataloging](https://www.loc.gov/marc/) -- libraries, books & media
